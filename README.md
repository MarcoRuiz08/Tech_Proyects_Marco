# Marco's Developer Portfolio 🚀

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio!

Here I document my learning journey, hands-on projects, and coding practice across multiple technologies and areas of software development.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a software engineer with 3+ years of experience in embedded systems and C++ development on Linux.  
Currently expanding into Java backend development, Python scripting, and SQL for data-driven solutions.

I'm passionate about building real-world projects, writing clean and maintainable code, and solving problems with a strong engineering mindset.
